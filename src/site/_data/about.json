  "aboutMe": "## Hey everyone! I'm Skylee.\n\nI'll try not to flesh this out too much. I'm an artist who enjoys cinema, gaming and video game collecting, making music, baking, sculpting, and sfx makeup, to name a few things. My ultimate goal is to one day become a full time artist and be able to make a living off of doing what I love. \n\nI’d like to think of myself as a woman of versatility and passion. Giving up is not an option. I take on life with a sense of rigor and fortitude and I encourage others to do the same. I’m not the most charismatic person, but I am a huge proponent for exploring yourself and doing/finding what you love and sticking to it. The possibilities in life are endless so don’t sell yourself short. Step outside your comfort zone and be comfortable doing it.\n\nHave any questions? Just ask. \n\nThanks for checking out/supporting my work :) You make it possible for me to keep working towards my dreams.",
