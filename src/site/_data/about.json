  "aboutMe": "## Hey everyone! I'm Skylee.\n\nI'll try not to flesh this out too much. I'm an artist who enjoys cinema, gaming and video game collecting, making music, baking, sculpting, and sfx makeup, to name a few things. My ultimate goal is to one day become a full time artist and to be able to make a living off of doing what I love. \n\nThroughout my years of being a creator I've become incredibly versatile. My willingness to try anything has shaped me to be the artist I am today, and I have only just begun. Giving up is not an option for me. I take on life with a sense of rigor and fortitude and I encourage others to do the same. I am a huge proponent for exploring yourself, trying new things, and finding what you love and sticking to it.Â If you take anything away from this, let it be this: Step outside your comfort zone. It will be difficult at first, but one day you will be comfortable doing it and you'll welcome the unpredictability. \n\nHave any questions? Just ask. \n\nThanks for checking out/supporting my work :) You make it possible for me to keep working towards my dreams.",
