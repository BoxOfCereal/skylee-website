  "aboutMe": "Hey everyone! I'm Skylee. One of my weaknesses is explaining things so I'll try not to flesh this out too much. I'm an artist who enjoys cinema, gaming and video game collecting, making music, baking, and sfx makeup, to name a few things. My ultimate goal is to become a tattooist. Tattooing is, in my opinion, the most personal and self expressive form of art. The idea of telling significant and insignificant anecdotes through imagery, the idea of you being your own little artistic time capsule...It’s brilliant. It’s archival. It says things about you that maybe you yourself don’t know how to say. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.  \n\nI’d like to think of myself as a woman of versatility and passion. Giving up is not an option. I take on life with a sense of rigor and fortitude and I encourage others to do the same. I’m not the most charismatic person, but I am a huge proponent for exploring yourself and doing/finding what you love and sticking to it. The possibilities in life are endless so don’t sell yourself short. Step outside your comfort zone and be comfortable doing it.\n\nThanks for checking out my work :)",
