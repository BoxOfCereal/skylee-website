  "aboutMe": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nSo you’ve made it this far and you might be wondering who I am. I’ll try to break it down for you. I'm an artist who enjoys cinema, gaming, music, baking, and overall being spontaneous. I work in a variety of different mediums, such as Prismacolor pencils, acrylic and watercolor paints, gouache, and digital. My main goal is to become a tattooist. Tattooing is, in my opinion, the most personal and self expressive form of art. The idea of telling significant and insignificant anecdotes through imagery, the idea of you being your own little artistic time capsule...It’s brilliant. It’s archival. It says things about you that maybe you yourself don’t know how to say. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words. I have learned so much about myself as a person through learning about this particular art form. \n\nI’d like to think of myself as a woman of versatility and passion. Giving up is not an option. I take on life with a sense of rigor and fortitude and I encourage others to do the same. I’m not the most charismatic person, but I am a huge proponent for exploring yourself and doing/finding what you love and sticking to it. The possibilities in life are endless so don’t sell yourself short. Step outside your comfort zone and be comfortable doing it.\n\nThanks for checking out my work\n\nSkylee \n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
